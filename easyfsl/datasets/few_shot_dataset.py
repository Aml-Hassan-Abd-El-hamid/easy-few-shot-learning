    Abstract class for all datasets used in a context of Few-Shot Learning.
    The tools we use in few-shot learning, especially TaskSampler, expect an
    implementation of FewShotDataset.
    Compared to PyTorch's Dataset, FewShotDataset forces a method get_labels.
    This exposes the list of all items labels and therefore allows to sample
    items depending on their label.
